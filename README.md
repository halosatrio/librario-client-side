# Project: Librario ðŸ“šðŸ“–

This project is my first attempt to make web app using ReactJS. In this project I also use _node-sass_, _react-datepicker_, and _redux_.

You can read the development process of building this app in my [blog post](https://halosatrio.now.sh/posts/project-librario/) **(written in Bahasa Indonesia)**

You can also visit [the app](https://librario.netlify.app/) (deployed on netlify)
